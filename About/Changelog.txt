# Changelog for ColonistsDeco

1.4.5 - Fixed the issue with the missing creator of decorations, also error when a room only have non-hangable walls


1.4.4 - Ascetic pawns will not decorate their room. Decorators name will now be saved correctly


1.4.3 - Should support more end-tables, as long as they already have a lamp on them


1.4.2 - Fixed a cell-check and hopefully stops pawns from decorating if their room is outside, as they would consider the whole map for it.
