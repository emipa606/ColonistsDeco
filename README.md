Update of Abe Vrienss mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2558083020

**The release of RimWorld 1.6 added improved support for [Asset Bundles](https://github.com/emipa606/AssetBuilder/blob/main/README.md).**
To avoid doubling the size of the mod, it was re-released using only Asset Bundles, you can find the new version of this mod [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3511154027).
This version will not receive any further updates.

- Should support more end-tables, as long as they dont already have a lamp on them

- Colonists will decorate their bedroom with all kinds of decorations. Doing this levels up their construction skill.
- Decoration levels can be researched, each research reflects a different tech level.
